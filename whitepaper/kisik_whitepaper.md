# Kisik Project Whitepaper

## Introduction

The **Kisik** project is an attempt to combine blockchain technology with human warmth, care, and attention to those who are often left out of digital inclusion. This is not just a token — it is the philosophy of a meme kitten offering you coffee, regardless of whether you can see it or not.

## Idea

The idea was born from the desire to create more than just a digital asset — but a place of attraction for people with special needs. The inspiration came from a girl named Anna, who once said: “Why not make a token where visually impaired people could feel like part of something kind?”

And so **Kisik** was born — a cat that symbolizes warmth, acceptance, and a gentle, friendly Web3.

## Project Goals

- Support for people with disabilities, especially the visually impaired.
- Building an open and inclusive community around meme culture and blockchain.
- Development of visual and audio NFTs accessible to all.
- Promoting kindness and soulfulness in the world of cryptocurrency.

Have a coffee. Smile. And share the warmth.
