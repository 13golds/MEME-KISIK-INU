### âœ… Acknowledgement

- A dedicated Telegram channel for swap activity updates is being considered for future community engagement.

- We acknowledge Jupiter may not list this token in the default UI unless it meets volume or community support criteria.
- This token is currently available for swap via Jupiter using direct link:  
  https://jup.ag/swap/SOL-3DbBHBf3cJShKe3MCwCSbqecL92GCNFeTRdeBcHqon48

- Kisik is not just a meme token â€” itâ€™s a character with a story.  
  A cozy white cat offering coffee in Web3 â€” symbol of calm, creativity, and community vibes.

- An NFT series is in development. Token holders will have early access and community-driven roles in minting decisions.

- We are building a Telegram bot to notify users about swap activity and community engagement tools â€” built with accessibility in mind.

- All project metadata, visuals, and documentation are maintained in the GitHub repository:  
  https://github.com/13golds/MEME-KISIK-INU

- The Kisik NFT collection explores emotions, daily moments, and dreams through the life of a symbolic character â€” inspiring young people to connect with Web3 not through hype, but through warmth, identity and storytelling.

- A special NFT giveaway campaign is being prepared behind the scenes â€” intended not for publicity, but to bring joy and inspiration to children, including those with disabilities, through the quiet power of art and technology.

- Each NFT in the Kisik collection will have an assigned symbolic value in KISIK tokens, reflecting its uniqueness, emotional theme, and rarity â€” forming the foundation of a gentle, community-driven token economy.

- We are also exploring creative distribution formats, such as:
  - "Share a Dream" â€” a Telegram bot where people can send short personal dreams, and Kisik will gift NFTs to selected submissions as quiet acts of support.
  - "Find Kisik" â€” a soft digital treasure hunt across GitHub Pages and linked content, where curious seekers discover hidden NFT drops in playful ways.
