✨ What is Kisik?

Kisik is a meme token with charm and curiosity. It was born as a playful digital cat who invites you for coffee ☕ — and maybe some fun along the journey to early discovery.

Holding Kisik means being part of a light-hearted but ambitious community that embraces creativity, fun, and long-term digital legacy.

“Even in the coldest blockchain, there lives a warm cat with a dream.”
