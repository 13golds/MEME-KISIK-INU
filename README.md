## About the Project

**Kisik** is a token inspired by the image of a fictional cat that invites everyone for a coffee, regardless of their physical abilities.  
It was created with respect for people with visual impairments and disabilities, aiming to bring warmth and care into the blockchain world.

> Even if you can't see the cup — you can still feel the warmth.

## Project Values

- **Inclusiveness** — Kisik is for everyone, especially for those who rarely receive attention.
- **Simplicity** — everything is fully transparent: 10 billion tokens, no minting, revocations or hidden conditions.
- **A Kind Meme** — a cat you want to be friends with.
